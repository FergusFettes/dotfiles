# My dotfiles

Will start to migrate all my configs from privtext to here. Just need to add [instructions](scripts/install_stow.sh) for installing GNU stow.

# TODO

* consider adding zsh plugins
* consider adding oh-my-zsh entirely
* consider adding a selection of vim plugins
* can also have sections for credentials for different services
