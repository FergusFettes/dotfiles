# My dotfiles

Will start to migrate all my configs from privtext to here. Just need to add [instructions](scripts/install_stow.sh) for installing GNU stow.

# TODO

* consider adding zsh plugins
* consider adding a selection of vim plugins

keybindings in 'dconf' need to be loaded:

`dconf load /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/ < ./dconf/keybindings.dconf`

`dconf load /org/gnome/desktop/wm/custom-keybindings/ < ./dconf/custom-keybindings/keybindings.dconf`
